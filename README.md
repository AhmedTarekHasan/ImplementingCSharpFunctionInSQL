# Implementing C# Function In SQL

<br/>

Have you ever needed to use regular expressions in a SQL SELECT statement?

<br/>

Me myself, I have. One day I needed to write a SQL script to fix a data issue on the production environment DB. Fixing this issue required to write a complex script which will carry out complex logic including comparing some columns data values with others using some patterns. It was a nightmare for me and some of my team members to write such script especially that SQL doesn't heavily support such operations.

<br/>

So, I dreamed that I can use regular expressions in my SQL UPDATE statement, this will spare my life. But, how?? SQL doesn't know regular expressions. I decided to search for any alternatives and I found it. You can write C# code and use it as a function in SQL!!!
